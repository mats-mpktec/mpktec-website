    <h1>Privacy Policy for Simple PDF Scanner App</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> August 16, 2025</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how MPK Tec AB ("we", "us", or "our") handles information in connection with your use of the Simple PDF Scanner App (the "App"). Our core principle is to respect your privacy. We have designed the App so that we do not collect, store, or have access to any of your personal data or scanned documents.</p>

    <h2>No Data Collection</h2>
    <p><strong>Simple PDF Scanner App does not collect, transmit, or store any personal information or user-generated content.</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Scanned Documents:</strong> All documents, images, and PDFs you create with the App are stored exclusively on your local device. They are never uploaded to our servers or any third-party service.</li>
        <li><strong>Personal Data:</strong> We do not ask for, collect, or have access to any personal data such as your name, email address, or location.</li>
        <li><strong>Analytics:</strong> The App does not use any third-party analytics or tracking tools.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>In-App Purchases</h2>
    <p>The App uses Apple's official In-App Purchase system to process payments for the PRO version. All transactions are handled securely by Apple. We do not receive or store any of your payment information, such as credit card numbers. We only receive an anonymous confirmation from Apple that a purchase has been made.</p>

    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <p>The App requests the following permissions for its core functionality:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Camera Access:</strong> To allow you to scan documents.</li>
        <li><strong>Photo Library Access:</strong> To allow you to import existing images to create PDFs (a PRO feature).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This access is used only for the App's functionality and the data is processed only on your device.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
