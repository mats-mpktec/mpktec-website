    <h1>Privacy Policy for Coordinate Converter App</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> August 30, 2025</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how MPK Tec AB ("we", "us", or "our") handles information in connection with your use of the Coordinate Converter App (the "App"). Our core principle is to respect your privacy. We have designed the App so that we do not collect, store, or have access to any of your personal data.</p>

    <h2>No Data Collection</h2>
    <p><strong>Coordinate Converter App does not collect, transmit, or store any personal information or user-generated content.</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Location Data and Coordinates:</strong> Any location data obtained via GPS or coordinates you enter into the App are processed exclusively on your local device. This data is never uploaded to our servers or any third-party service.</li>
        <li><strong>Personal Data:</strong> We do not ask for, collect, or have access to any personal data such as your name, email address, or other personal identifiers.</li>
        <li><strong>Analytics:</strong> The App does not use any third-party analytics or tracking tools.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <p>The App requests the following permissions for its core functionality:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Location Services (GPS) Access:</strong> To allow the App to fetch your current geographical coordinates for conversion. This is an optional feature to simplify getting your current position.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This access is used only for the App's functionality and the data is processed only on your device. You can use the App's manual input features without granting this permission.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
