    <h1>Privacy Policy for Pilot Converter App</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> January 3, 2026</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how MPK Tec AB ("we", "us", or "our") handles information in connection with your use of the Pilot Converter App (the "App"). Our core principle is to respect your privacy. We have designed the App so that we do not collect, store, or have access to any of your personal data.</p>

    <h2>No Data Collection</h2>
    <p><strong>Pilot Converter App does not collect, transmit, or store any personal information or user-generated content on external servers.</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Calculator Data:</strong> All calculations performed in the App (fuel conversions, climb rates, time/distance calculations, crosswind calculations, holding entry calculations, etc.) are processed exclusively on your local device. No calculation data is ever uploaded to our servers or any third-party service.</li>
        <li><strong>Personal Data:</strong> We do not ask for, collect, or have access to any personal data such as your name, email address, or other personal identifiers.</li>
        <li><strong>Analytics:</strong> The App does not use any third-party analytics or tracking tools.</li>
        <li><strong>Advertising:</strong> The App does not display any advertisements or use advertising networks.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Local Data Storage</h2>
    <p>All app data is stored only locally on your device and never leaves your device:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Settings:</strong> Your app preferences (language, theme, maximum crosswind limit, etc.) are stored locally on your device.</li>
        <li><strong>Rules & Notes:</strong> Any rules or notes you create are stored exclusively on your device and are never transmitted to our servers.</li>
        <li><strong>Trial Status:</strong> Information about your trial period and PRO status is stored locally on your device.</li>
        <li><strong>Map Ruler Preferences:</strong> Your saved map ruler scales and unit preferences are stored locally on your device.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>In-App Purchases</h2>
    <p>The App offers an in-app purchase to upgrade to the PRO version. All purchase transactions are processed by Apple through the App Store. We do not have access to your payment information. Apple's handling of payment data is subject to <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
    <p>Purchase receipts are validated locally on your device using Apple's StoreKit framework. Your purchase status is stored locally on your device and can be restored using Apple's purchase restoration system.</p>

    <h2>In-App Review</h2>
    <p>The App may request you to rate and review the app. This functionality uses Apple's native in-app review system (SKStoreReviewController), which is handled entirely by iOS. We do not have access to whether you chose to leave a review or what you wrote. For more information, see <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

    <h2>No Permissions Required</h2>
    <p>The App does not require any special device permissions (such as location, camera, microphone, or contacts) to function. All features work entirely offline using only the data you manually input.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
