    <h1>Privacy Policy for Mileage Log</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> February 4, 2026</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how MPK Tec AB ("we", "us", or "our") handles
    information in connection with your use of the Mileage Log app (the "App").
    Our core principle is to respect your privacy. We have designed the App so
    that your data stays on your device and in your own iCloud account.</p>

    <h2>Data We Store</h2>
    <p><strong>Mileage Log stores only the data you create in the App.</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Trip data:</strong> Trip dates, times, distances, start/end
        locations, purpose, comments, project details, and route points.</li>
        <li><strong>Vehicle, driver, and company data:</strong> Information you add
        for reporting and organization.</li>
        <li><strong>Odometer readings:</strong> Annual readings you enter
        manually.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Where Your Data Is Stored</h2>
    <p>All data is stored locally on your device. If iCloud is enabled, your data
    is synchronized through Apple CloudKit between your devices using your own
    iCloud account. We do not operate any servers that store your trip data.</p>

    <h2>Location & Motion Data</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Location (GPS):</strong> Used to record trips when you start a
        GPS trip. Location data is stored only on your device and in your iCloud.</li>
        <li><strong>Motion & Fitness:</strong> Used to provide smart reminders for
        manually started trips. Motion data is processed locally on your device.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not access your location or motion data unless you start a GPS trip
    or enable features that require it.</p>

    <h2>CarPlay</h2>
    <p>The App uses Apple's official CarPlay integration to support trip start/
    stop. CarPlay usage does not send data to us or third parties.</p>

    <h2>Reports & Export</h2>
    <p>Reports (PDF/CSV) are generated locally on your device. If you share a
    report, it is shared by you through the standard iOS share sheet.</p>

    <h2>No Tracking or Third-Party Analytics</h2>
    <p>The App does not use third-party analytics, advertising SDKs, or tracking
    tools.</p>

    <h2>Payments</h2>
    <p>In-app purchases are processed by Apple. We do not receive or store any
    payment information. We only receive an anonymous confirmation from Apple that
    a purchase was made.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of
    any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to
    review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
